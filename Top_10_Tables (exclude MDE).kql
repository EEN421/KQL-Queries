// This query will break down your top 10 most expensive log sources (excluding Microsoft Defender for Endpoint [MDE] logs) in the last 90 days
// This is not the most efficient query performance-wise, as it queries 'everything' and can take a while to return results with large datasets.

//More efficient way below? 

Usage
| where TimeGenerated > ago(90d)
| where IsBillable == true
| summarize GB = round(sum(Quantity)/1000,2) by DataType
|extend dollar = round(GB*{CostPerGB},2)
| extend TotalCost=strcat('$', dollar)
| sort by TotalCost desc
| where DataType !contains 'device'
| limit 10
